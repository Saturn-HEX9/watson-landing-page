# Bluemix Tips and Tricks

- If you run into the issue of an annoying pop-up window from Bluemix that prompts you to enter credit card information,the most likely cause is:
  - You created a trial Bluemix account (this is probably before a corporate account subscription was initiated). Later on, a corporate Bluemix account is created and you were invited to work under that account. However, because the initial trial account still exists and is associated with your user id, you will continue to get the pop-up window from Bluemix prompting you to enter credit card information.
  - **Resolution:**
    1. Submit a Bluemix support ticket to delete the trial account. Make sure that you understand that **any data in that trial account will be lost!**
    1. Even though the Bluemix trial account is deleted, you can still log into bluemix using your id and then work under the corporate Bluemix account.
