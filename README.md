# Introduction - Getting Started

## The Watson Developer Cloud
The Watson Developer Cloud (WDC) is a collection of cogntive services hosted on the [IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) platform.  They are available as cloud based services.  These services include:
- **[Watson Conversation service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation/)** - which is used to drive conversations with end users.  Some of the more common use cases include customer care scenarios and chatbots.  Also check out the various Application Starter Kits which uses Watson Conversation to build a chatbot.
- **[Watson Discovery Service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery/)** - which is used to answer "long tail" questions, catalog knowledge and information, and retrieve relevant documents.
